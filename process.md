## Process
1. First I googled 'B.Laken Notebook' and found it from the github where has a repo called **ipython-wiki**, then I found the notebook which is under the **Reproducible academic publications** section.
2. I tried to run the very first block but I don't have the **future** module, so I use **pip install future** to install the future module.
3. I tried to run the second block but it has an error that the webpage cannot be found, so I just googled by the name of the csv file. Since there are too many **Mon\_soon\_data.csv** searching results, instead, I googled **Olou\_counts.csv**. Then I download both csv files from B.Laken's repository [Comment_BadruddinAslam2014](https://github.com/benlaken/Comment_BadruddinAslam2014/find/master)
4. For **Create plot object 1 (possible r and p-vals)** part, there is an error massage saying that _'numpy.float64' object cannot be interpreted as an integer_. After I compare the codes of plot of Object 2, I found out that the Object 1 codes don't have the bin width. So I just set **bin_num=25** for Pannel 1 then the block runs fine.
5. Next, in the reproduce MC_array block, I notice that it also needs a csv file called **Monsoon\_MC\_saved.csv**. So I download it from the same repository as I mentiond above. Moreover, there is a line code **tmp = []** at the bottom of the block which makes no sense because we need tmp as our data rather than a empty list. So I deleted it and everyting works fine.
